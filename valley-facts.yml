- When water flows from a mountain, the steeper it is the faster the water flows, and the deeper the valley it is that is created.
- The water flowing from the mountain to create the valley is from rain, snow, and melting ice. This water carves away at the mountain and the earth below for millions of years to create valleys.
- Valleys are either U-shaped or V-shaped and their shape and type is characterized by their formation.
- Large valleys created by glaciers are U-shaped, created over many thousands or millions of years as the large sheets of ice move down a mountain. These glaciers often follow a river valley, and change its shape from V to U.
- The weather in a valley is often protected from harsh storms and winds, but many are susceptible to flooding.
- When valleys sink below sea level they become sunken valleys. Their shape makes a good harbour.
- Valleys that are deep and wide are referred to as canyons.
- Erosion plays an important part in the formation of waterfalls. As a stream flows, it carries sediment that can erode the soft bed rock (limestone and sandstone) underneath. Eventually this cuts deep enough so that only harder rock, such as granite, remains. Waterfalls develop as the granite forms cliffs and ledges.
- Waterfalls themselves also contribute to erosion. Stream velocity increases as it nears a waterfall, increasing the amount of erosion. The movement of water at the top of a waterfall can flatten rocks at the edge. The plunge pool at the base gets bigger as rushing water and sediment erodes it and the area behind the waterfall is worn away, creating cave-like shelters
- Ledge (Classical, Curtain) waterfalls descend vertically over a cliff maintaining partial contact with the bedrock.
- Block (Sheet) waterfalls descend from a wide stream or river
- Cascade waterfalls descend over a series of rock steps, they are usually a relatively safe type of waterfall.
- Cataract waterfalls are large, powerful and often dangerous.
- Chute waterfalls force a large amount of water through narrow vertical passages at a high pressure.
- Fan waterfalls are like the name suggests, as the water descends it spreads out horizontally.
- Horsetail waterfalls will maintain contact with the bedrock underneath them.
- Multi-step (Tiered or Staircase) waterfalls are a series of waterfalls falling one after the other each with their own plunge pool.
- Plunge waterfalls are fast moving with horizontal thrust over the edge causing the water to completely lose contact with the bedrock.
- Punchbowl waterfalls descend in a constricted form that spreads out into a wide pool at their base.
- Segmented waterfalls form separate flows of water as they descend.
- Waterfalls can be grouped into 10 broad classes based on the average volume of water going over falls.
- Waterfall types include ledge waterfalls, block waterfalls, cascade waterfalls, cataract waterfalls, chute waterfalls, fan waterfalls, frozen waterfalls, horsetail waterfalls, multi-step waterfalls, plunge waterfalls, punchbowl waterfalls, and segmented waterfalls.
