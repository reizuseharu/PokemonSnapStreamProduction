- Barrier islands are long, narrow strips of sand with inlets at either end. Almost all of the ocean-facing beaches in North Carolina are barrier island beaches. The size and position of these islands have moved and changed over the course of history as a result of sea level changes.
- Spring tides happen when the Sun and the Moon are lined up and their combined gravitational pull upon the ocean water is at a maximum. These kinds of high tides happen during the full moon and the new moon and result in high tides that are especially high and low tides are especially low.
- Sea turtles come ashore only to lay their eggs. Female sea turtles return to the beach of their own birth in order to lay their eggs. Once the eggs are laid, the mother turtle covers the nest and returns to the ocean. Once the babies hatch, they head straight for the ocean too!
- Most ocean waves are caused by winds scraping against the surface of the water. For these types of waves, the wave that you see is really just energy from the air transferring to the water. While the energy may move great distances across the ocean, the water itself generally does not move far.
- Sandy beaches are mostly made of silica (SiO2) in the form of the mineral quartz.
- "Depending on the type of sediment that makes up the sand, beaches can come in many different colors such as: white, gray, gold-yellow, brown, red and black."
- The size of the sediment found on a beach is a good indication of the wave and wind energy in the area. Shorelines that are protected from waves and winds usually have finer sediment than exposed coastlines where small sediment is suspended within the turbulent waters.
- Steep beaches have a strong wave backwash that pulls material down the beach slowly making the slope gentler. Waves on beaches that have a gentle slope run up the beach powerfully, before falling back gently, therefore depositing material at the top, which slowly makes the beach steeper.
- A beach that remains undisturbed by modern human influences (such as nearby houses, resorts, shops, camps or hotels) is often called a wild beach.
- The longest beach in the world is arguably Praia do Cassino (Casino Beach) in the city of Rio Grande, Brazil. It is approximately 212 km (132mi) long.
